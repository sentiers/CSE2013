## Simple 8bit CPU
This project aims to construct a simple 8-bit CPU. It consists of classes such as ALU, CU, PC, IR, and AC. The CPU can process instructions such as LDA, STA, ADD, and MUL, and has internal memory operations such as read, write, and initialize.

## Two Pass Assembler
This project performs the Pass 1 and Pass 2 processes of a 2-pass assembler and outputs the results.
### Pass 1:
- Reads the source code and builds the symbol table.
- Calculates the memory location for each statement and assigns a unique label to each symbol.
- Generates an intermediate file that contains the symbol table and the calculated memory location for each statement.
### Pass 2:
- Reads the intermediate file generated by Pass 1.
- Translates each statement into machine code and generates the final object code.
- Performs error checking and reports any errors found.
- Outputs the final object code into an output file.
